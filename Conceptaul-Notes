An NFT is basically:
            A unique digital item (like art, music, video, in-game skin, land in a virtual world, etc.) with proof of ownership recorded on the blockchain.

Why do we use NFTs?
           -Ownership → You can prove you own something digital.
           -Scarcity → Creators can make only 1 or a limited number (like 10) NFTs, which makes them rare.
           -Tradability → You can buy, sell, or trade NFTs in marketplaces (like OpenSea).
           -Programmability → NFTs can have special rules (royalties to the artist on every resale, unlockable content, in-game utilities).

Where are NFTs used?
          -Digital Art → Artists sell unique digital artworks.
          -Gaming → Skins, weapons, land, or characters can be NFTs.
          -Collectibles → Like trading cards or rare digital items.
          -Music → Songs or albums can be released as NFTs.
          -Virtual Real Estate → In metaverse worlds like Decentraland.
          -Identity & Certificates → Diplomas, tickets, or ID could be NFTs in the future.

How are NFTs stored?
          -The token (ownership proof) is stored on the blockchain.
          -The digital file (art, music, etc.) is usually stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or another decentralized storage, and the token points to it.
